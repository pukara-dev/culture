# How to be a professional - Pukara

Last week, one of our prospects asked us, _"Are you professional?"_. This question led us to reflect on professionalism and inspired us to write this article. At Pukara, professionalism goes beyond simply doing a job; it's about living by principles that define who we are. Some of these values are reflected in the video “[Aprenda a tocar PANDEIRO em 2 minutos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM4KVoSpQ2M)”.

In summary, for us, being professional means:

## Achieving Goals

Professionals set clear, achievable goals and work towards them with determination. We focus on goals that drive our growth and add value to our clients.

## Being Consistent

Imagine you go to your favorite restaurant for your weekly salad, which you always enjoy, but each time you visit, the salad is different because the chef doesn’t follow a recipe. We are sure you not always be happy about it.

Success requires consistency. We establish processes that ensure everyone follows similar guidelines, so the outcome is excellent no matter who is involved.

## Going Beyond Expectations

Professionals don't just meet expectations; **they exceed them**. We aim to deliver more than what's expected in every project we undertake, whenever possible.

## Showing Respect

Maintaining professionalism means treating others with respect and integrity. We ensure clear, honest, and respectful communication with clients and collaborators.

## Building Trust & Security

It's important for people to feel safe and trust that things will improve. We focus on making you feel secure and confident that our work will exceed your expectations.
