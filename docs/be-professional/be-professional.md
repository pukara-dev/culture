# How to be a professional - Pukara

One of our prospects asked us, "Are you professional?", which led us to reflect on this and write this article. For Pukara, professionalism is about more than just doing a job: it's about living by principles that define who we are. Some of these values are reflected in the video “[Aprenda a tocar PANDEIRO em 2 minutos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM4KVoSpQ2M)”.
