Welcome to our Engineering Best Practices Wiki - your comprehensive guide to the engineering procedures, protocols, and methodologies we follow at Pukara.

This resource is designed to serve as a dynamic, growing knowledge base for both new and existing members of our engineering team. It's not merely a set of rules; it's a rich repository of collective wisdom and best practices that have been proven effective in our own engineering environment.
