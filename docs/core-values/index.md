# Pukara Core values

These values are a guide to orienting the decision taking. **When facing a dichotomy, they should be the ones guiding us.**

## **Initiative**

Be the type of person who gets things done, whether on your own or through other people.

The key skill is to set priorities and overcome procrastination.

Always find new ways to do your job. Be tolerant of failure and keep going

Examples:

- If we get issues we look for workarounds and solutions by ourselves before asking/escalating to someone else.
- Proactive Behavior

## **Integrity**

To be honest, trustworthy and ethical in our actions.

Do the work on time

This means doing the right thing and recognising the errors

Examples:

- **Don’t lie, please!**
- Be faithful, humble and respectful

## **Ability to adapt/adjust**

We need to be able to change and remain flexible when encountering new or different circumstances in order to achieve success.

Examples:

- We might have to pivot our business strategy in response to changes in the market. Or maybe to adopt new technologies as they become available. 
- Willing to change internal processes/policies in order to better serve customers or employees

## **Collaboration**

Be happy to share your knowledge and offer advice, so we can work together effectively with others in order to achieve common goals.

Examples:

- We want employees to work together on projects and to share ideas and resources in order to achieve better outcomes
- Cooperation and mutual support among employees

## **Communication**

Express in a clear way your needs and feelings.

Examples:

- Don’t be violent and implement frameworks as non-violent communication

## **Curiosity & Passion**

Approach every by day asking questions, being interested, and never stopping learning.

"The desire to constantly question concepts and processes in order to improve. Curious people are willing to leave their comfort zone and explore the possibilities, as they know the path will lead to progress." (ref [here](https://medium.com/@casafari/building-a-company-based-on-good-values-curiosity-16292acb6fb1))

Examples:

- [Hacker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)
- In IT, *troubleshooting* is a very important skill. We find software issues almost every day, to solve them we require curiosity and passion, otherwise we end up with a very frustrating day

## **Inclusion & Diversity**

Organizations should respect and appreciate differences in age, gender, ethnicity, education, physical abilities, race, and religion among individuals

Examples:

- We don’t care if you’re gay, Christian, Muslim, non-binary, etc

## **Commitment**

Be present at work, because you decided to be here and you will do your best
